hello! my name is courtney. i moved to nyc in 2018. <br>
i love going to new places, trying new foods, and meeting new people. <br>
i also love organizing shit - whether it's my closet or my kitchen, i like to group things together in a way that's intuituve and aesthetically pleasing.<br>
hence, this index. <br>

i built this index to honestly save myself time. i get requests about once a week (mostly from my mom) because her best friend's cousin's wife is visiting new york and they *need* recommendations. now i can just send her a link! <br>

so, to whomever is reading this, i hope this helps you! <br>
and the next time someone asks you "do you have any recs?" you can send them this ~~blog~~ index :)

if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello, dm me on instagram!
