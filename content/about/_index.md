if you're reading this then that means:

* you have an upcoming trip to mexico city and want to know the best places to eat while you're there
* you have a friend in town and want to take them somewhere cool
* you're going to philly for the weekend and want some food recs
* you're planning your birthday dinner and want to go somewhere trendy that can handle a party of 12
* you're organizing a work dinner and want to know where to ball out on the company dime

most likely my mom or brigid brahos sent you this blog :) <br>
but this is not a blog! this is an index. <br> 
a powerful index of all the places i've been and all the places i've eaten. <br>
everything is categorized by country, city, nyc neighborhood, occasion, vibe, year, etc. <br>
i even included some tips on how to dress (for my girly pops) and what you can expect when you get there
