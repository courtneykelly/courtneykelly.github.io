#### thoughts
* the tables are extremely tight. you will be on top of each other, but vibes couldn't be fresher. 
* it's always packed. 
* brunch is lit - especially if the sun is out, the hoes will be hoeing and the brunch will be brunching.

#### menu highlights
* low-key the schnitzel slaps
* arayes
