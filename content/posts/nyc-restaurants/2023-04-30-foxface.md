#### thoughts
* been going to foxface since their sandwhich shop window days - always got to try something fun and interesting. first time i ever had rabbit was on a sandwhich from here. their restaurant is no different, delicious & unique

#### menu highlights
* try something you've never heard of before, you'll probably love it
