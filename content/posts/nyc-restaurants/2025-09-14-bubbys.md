#### thoughts
* tribeca classic, total institution for brunch
* always packed, expect a wait but it moves
* quintessential comfort food, great for groups or when parents visit

#### menu highlights
* pancakes (james beard pancakes often mentioned)
* fried chicken (often paired with pancakes/waffles)
* biscuits
* pies (especially banana cream, apple)
* mac & cheese
