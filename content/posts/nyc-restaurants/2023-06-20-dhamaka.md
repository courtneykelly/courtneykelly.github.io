#### thoughts
to answer your question - "is it worth the hype?" - yes.

every time i walk into the essex market - most of the time to go to my favorite wine shop ([peoples](https://goo.gl/maps/hyx34jhlsetcy3ol8)) downstairs - i'm immediately drooling because of the amazing smells wafting from dhamaka. <br>
like stepping outside your air-conditioned apartment into 100% humidity in the middle of july, they hit you like a truck - but in a way that is actually quite pleasant and doesn't make you want to die.

#### menu highlights
* ragda pattice - this was my favorite dish
