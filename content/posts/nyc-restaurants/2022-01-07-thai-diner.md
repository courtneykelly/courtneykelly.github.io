#### thoughts
* i have waited anywhere from 20 mins to 1.5 hours for a table here, but it's deinitely worth it. better to get there early, put your name in, and grab a drink at one of the million bars in the area. i recommend [mother's ruin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q8ivnysqeotgmjzk9)
* they have limited resys, but i think they're more flexible for a large party of more than 7.

#### menu highlights
* disco fries
* pea shoots
* mango sticky rice
