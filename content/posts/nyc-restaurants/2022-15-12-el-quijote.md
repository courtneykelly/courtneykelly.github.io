#### thoughts
* they have a basement wine cellar you can rent out for a special event or birthday dinner!
* such a cool space. old and historic, but also trendy and cool.
* bar scene is cozy. also can easily walk through the double doors at the back of the restaurant and head into the lobby bar at hotel chelsea for a post-dinner drink.
