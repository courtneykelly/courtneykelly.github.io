#### thoughts
* sleek, moody vibe inside, definitely a cool spot for drinks on the les
* felt intimate, good for a date or catching up with a friend
* cocktails were creative and well-made, seemed like a focus on natural wine too

#### menu highlights
* cocktails (martinis often mentioned, unique seasonal options)
* wine selection (natural wines)
* small plates (olives, bread & butter, tinned fish, charcuterie)
