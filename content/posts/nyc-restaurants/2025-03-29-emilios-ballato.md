#### thoughts
* stand in line outside and wait for a table - we got there at 5 and were seated around 5:45
* you feel like you're inconvenciencing the staff by breathing air, part of the charm
* i'll know i've made it when they seat me in the back room
* walls covered in photos w/ celebs, absolutely timeless decor

#### menu highlights
* arrabiata
* chicken parm alla vodka
