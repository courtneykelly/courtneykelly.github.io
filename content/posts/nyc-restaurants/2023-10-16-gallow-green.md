#### thoughts
* restaurant on the roof of the mccitrick hotel, where they do [sleep no more](https://mckittrickhotel.com/events/sleep-no-more/#/)(a live reenactment of shakespeare's macbeth)
* very interesting vibe, staff are sometimes also actors in the show, quirky vibes
* summer only, no outdoor heaters so if it's cold dress warm
