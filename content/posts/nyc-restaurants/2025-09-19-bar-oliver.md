#### thoughts
* cute neighborhood wine bar, very greenpoint
* perfect for a low-key date or just chilling with wine and snacks
* staff knows their stuff about the wines and are super friendly

#### menu highlights
* natural wine selection (orange wines often mentioned)
* cheese/charcuterie boards
* small plates (like bread & butter, olives, sardines)
