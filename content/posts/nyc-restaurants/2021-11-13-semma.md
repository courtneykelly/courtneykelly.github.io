#### thoughts
* the best restaurant in new york.
* such a tough res, but i think bar seating might be first come first serve.
* they only book through resy and allow max number of 6 people per table.

#### menu highlights
* can't go wrong. you could blindly point at the menu and end up with the best meal of your life.
* pre-ordering the dungeness crab is so worth it.
