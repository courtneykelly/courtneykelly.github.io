#### thoughts
* this is my favorite restaurant in nyc. it's simple comfort food that makes my heart happy. 
* i always take visitors here and it's my go to place for a last minute celebration meal with the roomies - so many good memories here. 

#### menu highlights
* larb moo
* por pia larb moo - not sure what they put in the dipping sauce buts it's as addictive as ranch.
