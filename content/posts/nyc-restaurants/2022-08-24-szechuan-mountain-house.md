#### thoughts
* this was the first time i has proper szechuan food. i thought i was having an allergic reaction because of the sensations the peppercorns created in my mouth. so don't fret! it's just *that* good. 

#### menu highlights
* swing pork belly
* la-zi chicken
* sauteed chinese long beans w. eggplant
