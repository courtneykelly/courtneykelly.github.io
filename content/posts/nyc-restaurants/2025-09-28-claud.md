#### thoughts
* lives up to the hype, food and wine are both excellent
* resy is impossible, gotta plan way ahead or try for bar seats right at open
* tiny space but makes it feel intimate and buzzy, very east village

#### menu highlights
* devil's chicken (whole roasted chicken - order in advance!)
* swordfish au poivre
* razor clams
* escargot croquettes
* chocolate cake (if you skip the chicken)
